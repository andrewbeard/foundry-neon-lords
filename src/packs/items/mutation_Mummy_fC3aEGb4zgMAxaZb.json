You lose your class but can spend Class Points to cast War Wizard spells (All level 1 and level 2.)</p><p class=\"p1\">In addition, you can spend a Class Point to transform into an Avatar of Doom for [[/roll 1D6]] turns. While in the Avatar form your base HP is 10 and your movement speed is changed to 45ft. The Avatar makes Attacks with the Fist of Doom dealing [[/roll 1D8+2]] damage. When the Avatar reaches 0 HP, you are transformed again into the frail mummy.</p>"
