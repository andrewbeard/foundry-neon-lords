Paper or a book will be engulfed in flames. Creatures touched take [[/roll 1D6]] Burning damage. The spellâ€™s duration varies. In its basic form, the spell duration is Instant. By spending a Khaos Point, the caster may extend this duration to a Round, adding additional Rounds of duration for each Khaos Point expended.</p>",
