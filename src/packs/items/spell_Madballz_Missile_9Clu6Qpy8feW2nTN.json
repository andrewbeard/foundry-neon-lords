    "description": "<p>The War Wizard focuses their hatred into ballz of mad evil magic. The missile manifests itself uniquely for each War Wizard. At 1st level, the caster creates 3 balls dealing [[/roll 1D4+1]] damage each. They can choose up to 3 targets. The ballz ignore both cover and armor. The War Wizard may expend additional Khaos Points to manifest more ballz. Two Khaos Points allow for an additional ball, 5 Khaos Points for 2 extra ballz, and 8 Khaos Points for 3 more ballz. Khaos Points can be spent to make the ballz more powerful, as well, with 1 Khaos Points causing each ball to deal [[/roll 1D4+2]] damage, [[/roll 1D6+1]] damage per ball for 2 Khaos Points, and [[/roll 1D8+1]] damage per ball for 3 Khaos Points.</p>",
